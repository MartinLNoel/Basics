# Basics
Created a function that takes an int as a parameter and uses that int as the range.
Made a variable that counts up to that number.
While counting up there is an if statement checking whether the countUp number is divisible by 3 or 5.
If it is, it adds it to another variable called sum.
The whole function ruterns that sum variable
